## Welcome to RocketOff - The app for when people need to knock it off
Do you:
- Love Houston Sports?
- Enjoy watching top-tier athletes on repeat in top-tier reaction GIFs?
- Have teammates with SERIOUS behavior issues?
- Enjoy annoying people by wearing out (two very specific) once-great memes?

Then I have the chat application for you!

### Usage
This highly utilitarian, productivity application for slack has two endpoints that can be invoked via slack slash commands. The command to use depends on what type of teammate behavior you'd like correct. See below for the available commands and sample usage.

#### The Beard
The following commands will invoke a reply with a GIF reminding relevant members of the channel or DM that they are lame and should move on:
- `/the-beard`
- `/i'm-done`

#### The Point God
The following commands will will invoke a reply with a GIF reminding relevant members of the channel or DM that they are not funny and should probably stop trying to be:
- `/point-god`
- `/no-one-likes-you`

### Privacy Policy
I don't store any of your data. Period. I couldn't if I wanted to. There is no data persistence in this application of any kind. The only data collected is whatever slack does on their end. Even if James Harden himself offered me season tickets for the names of everyone who uses my app, I could not give them to him. See the source code if you'd like some reassurance.

### Support
I have no idea what you could possibly need help with, but if you do need something, you can contact me via this git repository or at rocketguy3@gmail.com.
