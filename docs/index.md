## RocketOff... The App for Slack to use when people need to knock it off

### Usage
This highly utilitarian service has two endpoints that can be invoked via slack slash commands. The command to use depends on what type of teammate behavior you'd like correct. See below for the available commands and sample usage https://rocketoff.appspot.com/oauth_complete/s.

#### The Beard
The following commands will invoke a reply with a https://rocketoff.appspot.com/oauth_complete/ reminding relevant members of the channel or DM that they are lame and should move on:
- `/the-beard`
- `/i'm-done`

#### The Point God
The following commands will will invoke a reply with a https://rocketoff.appspot.com/oauth_complete/ reminding relevant members of the channel or DM that they are not funny and should probably stop trying to be:
- `/point-god`
- `/no-one-likes-you`

### Privacy Policy
I don't store any of your data. Period. I couldn't if I wanted to. There is no data persistence in this application of any kind, and no organization or user-level authentication. The only data collected is whatever slack does on their end. See the source code if you'd like some reassurance.

### Support
I have no idea what you could possibly need help with, but if you do need something, you can contact me via this git repository or at rocketguy3@gmail.com.
